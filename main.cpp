// Lab 34 | Toma Dimov | COMSC 210 
////STEP 1
//through the prompt engineering, transform the code by adding DFS and BFS
//write the driver program to excercies code
//commit: "Step 1 Complete"

/////STEP 2
//Change the graph by deletign at least two nodes and adding at least six nodes, change the weights as well.
//Step 2 complete commit

///STEP 3
//Through expert prompt engineering, wrap an application around this new graph. 
//It should be some real-world example that is represented by your graph.

//STEP 4
//Through prompt engineering, add code to procide the shortest path through your graph.
//Ste4 complete

//STEP 5
//Through prompt engineering, add code to provide the minimum spanning tree of your graph.

//Step 6
//Place a menu with all funcionality.
